ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Anas Arkawi!

I'm currently a student working on mainly Web Development and some AI projects. I mainly work with JavaScript and Python.

I got some experience with various frameworks and libraries like express.js, react.js, etc.

I'm open to collaborate on various projects and I'm also open to work on freelance deb development work. If you're interested in the latter, check out my [PeoplePerHour](https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelancer/technology-programming/anas-arkawi-web-developer-jnzyjya) page!

And as any other programmer, I have a caffinee addiction and I need financing, so you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anasarkawi)
