üëã Hi, I'm Anas Arkawi!

I'm currently a student working mainly on web development and data analysis projects using JavaScript and Python. My projects include Mercury, an algorithmic trading library used to trade on cryptocurrency markests using technical analysis, which is a sub-project of Lycon, a platform aimed to make algorithmic trading accesible not only to the corporate hedge-funds but also for the general public.

Throughout my coding journey, I've employed many tools and libraries that all helped me with all sorts of projects and tasks. Some of these libraries inlcude:
* React
* Express.js
* Next.js
* Chakra UI
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Flask

Some of the projects that may pique you interest include:
* [Lycon](https://github.com/Lycon-io): An algorithmic trading platform aimed to make algorithmic trading and quantitative finance accesible for the general public.
* [Mercury](https://github.com/Lycon-io/mercury): A library at the heart of Lycon that allows you to calculate and use technical indicators to automatically place orders in cryptocurrency markets.
* [Signal](https://github.com/anasarkawi1/signal-backtesting-server): A proof-of-concept backtesting server written in JavaScript and based on Express.js Web Framework.
* [PoetryPark.Club](https://github.com/anasarkawi1/poetrypark.club-archive): Now archieved proof-of-concept social media website with a focus on sharing of litreature, poetry, and art. The platform is written in PHP and takes advantage of the LAMP stack.

Currently, I'm working on the above listed projects. If you're interested in collaborating on a project you can reach out to me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anasarkawi_/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anas-arkawi/). I'm also open to work on freelance web development work. If you're interested, check out my [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01644f4ae9868c0335) page!

And as any other programmer, I have a caffinee addiction and I need financing üòÅ, so you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anasarkawi)
