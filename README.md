üëã Hi, I'm Anas Arkawi!

I'm currently a student working mainly on Web Development and some AI projects using JavaScript and Python.

I got some experience with various frameworks and libraries like express.js, react.js, next.js, etc.

I mainly work on JavaScript and python based projects. Most of my projects revolve around web development but some also revolve around other topics such as data analysis and finance (for example, my back testing server [Signal](https://github.com/anasarkawi1/signal-backtesting-server)).

Some of the frameworks and libraries are:
* React
* Next.js
* Chakra UI
* Numpy
* Pandas

Currently, I'm working on web development and quantitative finance projects. If you're interested in collaborating on a project you can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnasArkawi_). I'm also open to work on freelance web development work. If you're interested, check out my [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01644f4ae9868c0335) page!

And as any other programmer, I have a caffinee addiction and I need financing üòÅ, so you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anasarkawi)
